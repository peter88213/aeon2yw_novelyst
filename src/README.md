# Please note:

Location of the  **PyWriter**  library: https://github.com/peter88213/PyWriter
Location of the **aeon2ywlib** library: https://github.com/peter88213/aeon2yw

It is advised to clone these projects at the same directory level as the  *aeon2yw_novelyst*  project and set a project reference to it. So the build scripts can generate the  *aeon2yw_novelyst*  plugin.
